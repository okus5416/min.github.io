        <h2>About Min!</h2>

<pre><font face="Comic sans MS" size="5">Hello, This is Min! I am currently at my second
        semester at University of Waterloo as a first year software engineering student.
        I developed different skills throughout high school and university years and I really
        love to solve complicate problems which demand hard works and certain amount of time.
        I currently have a huge amount of interests in developing softwares with various programming
        languagess and tools. I am capable of adopting new skills very quickly and I am dreaming of becoming
        a professional programmer.

        
        I have plenty of programming skills with different programming languages, such
        as C,C++, python, visual basics, and Java.
        I am also capable of developing web with HTML5/CSS, using modernizer and
        javascript. I am also pursuing to learn about mobile apps
        so that I can further my skills in the field of software engineering.
